## System Architecture

BrightPath follows a modern, scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns. The revised architecture now includes PostgreSQL with JSONB fields for flexible data storage, with browser local storage used for questionnaire progress in the initial prototype:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  React Frontend │────▶│  Django API     │────▶│  PostgreSQL     │
│  (Vite)         │◀────│  (REST)         │◀────│  (with JSONB)   │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
        │                        │                       
        │                        │                       
        ▼                        ▼                       
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     
│                 │     │                 │     
│  Local Storage  │     │  ML Services    │     
│  (Questionnaire)│     │                 │     
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     
```

The architecture consists of five main components:

1. **Frontend Application:** A responsive React-based single-page application that provides an intuitive user interface for schedule creation, management, and feedback.

2. **Backend API:** A Django REST Framework API that handles user authentication, data management, and business logic.

3. **Database (PostgreSQL with JSONB):** A robust relational database that leverages JSONB fields to combine structured data integrity with document flexibility. This approach provides:
   - Structured tables for core data (users, families, children, subjects)
   - JSONB fields for complex hierarchical data (preferences, schedules)
   - Strong transaction guarantees across all data
   - Advanced querying capabilities for both relational and document data

4. **Local Storage (Browser):** Used for storing questionnaire progress during onboarding in the initial prototype, allowing users to save and continue the questionnaire across sessions.

5. **ML Services:** Machine learning models for schedule generation and optimization, with a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

## Authentication Strategy

BrightPath will implement Google OAuth for authentication, providing a secure and familiar sign-in experience for users:

1. **User Registration/Login Flow:**
   - User clicks "Sign in with Google" button
   - User authorizes the application through Google's consent screen
   - User is redirected back to BrightPath with authorization code
   - Backend exchanges code for tokens and creates/updates user account
   - User session is established

2. **Benefits:**
   - Simplified onboarding process
   - Reduced security risks by leveraging Google's authentication
   - Familiar experience for users
   - Reduced development time for authentication features

## UI Component Strategy

BrightPath will use Radix UI for its component library, providing accessible, composable primitives that can be styled to match the design system:

1. **Component Architecture:**
   - Radix UI primitives as the foundation
   - Custom component library built on top of primitives
   - CSS Modules for component-specific styling
   - Design tokens for consistent theming

2. **Benefits:**
   - Accessibility built-in
   - Consistent behavior across components
   - Flexibility in styling
   - Reduced development time for complex components

## Database Strategy

BrightPath will use PostgreSQL with JSONB fields for persistent storage, with browser local storage for questionnaire progress in the initial prototype:

1. **PostgreSQL with JSONB for Persistent Storage:**
   - Structured tables for core entities (users, families, children, subjects)
   - JSONB fields for flexible data (preferences, questionnaire responses, schedules)
   - Best of both worlds: Schema enforcement where needed, flexibility where appropriate
   - Strong transaction guarantees and referential integrity

2. **Key Data Storage Areas:**
   - Family profiles and preferences (structured + JSONB)
   - Child information and learning styles (structured + JSONB)
   - Subject and activity definitions (structured)
   - Generated schedules (structured references + JSONB for schedule details)
   - Activity completion logs (structured + JSONB for flexible details)
   - ML model parameters and training data (structured + JSONB)
   - Final questionnaire responses (JSONB)

3. **Local Storage for Questionnaire Progress:**
   - Draft questionnaire responses
   - Section completion status
   - Current position in the questionnaire flow
   - Temporary user preferences during onboarding

4. **Benefits:**
   - Single database to maintain and scale
   - Schema flexibility for evolving requirements
   - Strong transaction guarantees for all operations
   - Simplified initial implementation using local storage
   - No need for additional infrastructure in the prototype phase
   - Advanced querying capabilities for both structured and document data

## Questionnaire Design

The BrightPath onboarding questionnaire follows a TurboTax-like experience to gather essential information for personalized schedule generation:

1. **Key Design Principles:**
   - Progressive disclosure - Questions are organized in logical sections
   - Smart defaults - Age-appropriate suggestions based on child's age
   - Visual assistance - Examples and visual aids enhance understanding
   - Save progress - Automatic saving to local storage for later continuation

2. **Multi-Child Support:**
   - Family-wide sections collected once
   - Child-specific sections repeated for each child
   - Clear navigation between children and sections

3. **Core Sections:**
   - Parent/Guardian Information
   - Child Information
   - Commitments & Obligations
   - Subjects & Activities
   - Schedule Flexibility
   - Preferred Learning Times
   - Learning & Teaching Preferences

4. **Implementation:**
   - Draft responses stored in browser local storage
   - Final responses committed to PostgreSQL JSONB fields
   - Progress tracking across browser sessions
   - Smart validation and suggestions

## Machine Learning Approach

BrightPath implements two key ML models:

1. **Schedule Generator Model:** Creates personalized schedules based on user preferences collected during onboarding.

2. **Reward Model:** Evaluates schedule quality based on user feedback and implicit signals.

These models work together in a continuous improvement loop:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │
│  User Feedback  │────▶│  Reward Model   │
│                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │
│  New Schedules  │◀────│ Generator Model │
│                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Development Approach

The development of BrightPath follows an iterative, phased approach:

1. **Foundation Phase:** Establish project infrastructure, implement core authentication, and create database schemas for PostgreSQL with JSONB fields.

2. **Core Functionality Phase:** Implement onboarding questionnaire with local storage, schedule management, and initial rule-based schedule generation.
