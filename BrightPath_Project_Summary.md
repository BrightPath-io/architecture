## System Architecture

BrightPath follows a modern, scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  React Frontend │────▶│  Django API     │────▶│  Database       │
│  (Vite)         │◀────│  (REST)         │◀────│  (PostgreSQL)   │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                               │   ▲
                               ▼   │
                        ┌─────────────────┐
                        │                 │
                        │  ML Services    │
                        │                 │
                        └─────────────────┘
```

The architecture consists of four main components:

1. **Frontend Application:** A responsive React-based single-page application that provides an intuitive user interface for schedule creation, management, and feedback.

2. **Backend API:** A Django REST Framework API that handles user authentication, data management, and business logic.

3. **Database:** A PostgreSQL database that stores user data, schedules, and application state.

4. **ML Services:** Machine learning models for schedule generation and optimization, with a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

## Authentication Strategy

BrightPath will implement Google OAuth for authentication, providing a secure and familiar sign-in experience for users:

1. **User Registration/Login Flow:**
   - User clicks "Sign in with Google" button
   - User authorizes the application through Google's consent screen
   - User is redirected back to BrightPath with authorization code
   - Backend exchanges code for tokens and creates/updates user account
   - User session is established

2. **Benefits:**
   - Simplified onboarding process
   - Reduced security risks by leveraging Google's authentication
   - Familiar experience for users
   - Reduced development time for authentication features

## UI Component Strategy

BrightPath will use Radix UI for its component library, providing accessible, composable primitives that can be styled to match the design system:

1. **Component Architecture:**
   - Radix UI primitives as the foundation
   - Custom component library built on top of primitives
   - CSS Modules for component-specific styling
   - Design tokens for consistent theming

2. **Benefits:**
   - Accessibility built-in
   - Consistent behavior across components
   - Flexibility in styling
   - Reduced development time for complex components

## Message Processing Strategy

BrightPath will use Valkey as the message bus for asynchronous task processing:

1. **Task Processing Architecture:**
   - Valkey for message storage and distribution
   - Worker processes for task execution
   - Task queues for different types of operations
   - Result storage and retrieval

2. **Benefits:**
   - Improved performance over traditional message brokers
   - Simplified deployment and management
   - Reliable message delivery
   - Scalable processing capacity

## Machine Learning Approach

BrightPath implements two key ML models:

1. **Schedule Generator Model:** Creates personalized schedules based on user preferences collected during onboarding.

2. **Reward Model:** Evaluates schedule quality based on user feedback and implicit signals.

These models work together in a continuous improvement loop:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │
│  User Feedback  │────▶│  Reward Model   │
│                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                               │
                               ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │
│  New Schedules  │◀────│ Generator Model │
│                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

## Development Approach
